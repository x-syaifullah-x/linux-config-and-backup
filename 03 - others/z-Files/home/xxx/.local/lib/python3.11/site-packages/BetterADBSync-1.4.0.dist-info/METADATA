              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

# Better ADB Sync

An [rsync](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/rsync)-like program to sync files between a computer and an Android device

## Installation

Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/BetterADBSync/)

```
$ pip install BetterADBSync
```

## QRD

To push from your computer to your phone use
```
$ adbsync push LOCAL ANDROID
```

To pull from your phone to your computer use
```
$ adbsync pull ANDROID LOCAL
```

Full help is available with `$ adbsync --help`

## Intro

This is a (pretty much from scratch) rewrite of Google's [adbsync](https://github.com/google/adb-sync) repo.

The reason for the rewrite is to

1. Update the repo to Python 3 codestyle (strings are by default UTF-8, no more b"" and u"", classes don't need to inherit from object, 4 space indentation etc)
2. Add in support for `--exclude`, `--exclude-from`, `--del`, `--delete-excluded` like `rsync` has (this required a complete rewrite of the diffing algorithm)

## Additions

- `--del` will delete files and folders on the destination end that are not present on the source end. This does not include exluded files.
- `--delete-excluded` will delete excluded files and folders on the destination end.
- `--exclude` can be used many times. Each should be a `fnmatch` pattern relative to the source. These patterns will be ignored unless `--delete-excluded` is specified.
- `--exclude-from` can be used many times. Each should be a filename of a file containing `fnmatch` patterns relative to the source.

## Possible future TODOs

I am satisfied with my code so far, however a few things could be added if they are ever needed

- `--backup` and `--backup-dir-local` or `--backup-dir-android` to move outdated / to-delete files to another folder instead of deleting

adb-sync
========

adb-sync is a tool to synchronize files between a PC and an Android device
using the ADB (Android Debug Bridge).

Related Projects
================

Before getting used to this, please review this list of projects that are
somehow related to adb-sync and may fulfill your needs better:

* [rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/) is a file synchronization tool for local
  (including FUSE) file systems or SSH connections. This can be used even with
  Android devices if rooted or using an app like
  [SSHelper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arachnoid.sshelper).
* [adbfs](http://collectskin.com/adbfs/) is a FUSE file system that uses adb to
  communicate to the device. Requires a rooted device, though.
* [adbfs-rootless](https://github.com/spion/adbfs-rootless) is a fork of adbfs
  that requires no root on the device. Does not play very well with rsync.
* [go-mtpfs](https://github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs) is a FUSE file system to
  connect to Android devices via MTP. Due to MTP's restrictions, only a certain
  set of file extensions is supported. To store unsupported files, just add
  .txt! Requires no USB debugging mode.

Setup
=====

Android Side
------------

First you need to enable USB debugging mode. This allows authorized computers
(on Android before 4.4.3 all computers) to perform possibly dangerous
operations on your device. If you do not accept this risk, do not proceed and
try using [go-mtpfs](https://github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs) instead!

On your Android device:

* Go to the Settings app.
* If there is no "Developer Options" menu:
  * Select "About".
  * Tap "Build Number" seven times.
  * Go back.
* Go to "Developer Options".
* Enable "USB Debugging".

PC Side
-------

* Install the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) (the
  stand-alone Android SDK "for an existing IDE" is sufficient). Alternatively,
  some Linux distributions come with a package named like "android-tools-adb"
  that contains the required tool.
* Make sure "adb" is in your PATH. If you use a package from your Linux
  distribution, this should already be the case; if you used the SDK, you
  probably will have to add an entry to PATH in your ~/.profile file, log out
  and log back in.
* `git clone https://github.com/google/adb-sync`
* `cd adb-sync`
* Copy or symlink the adb-sync script somewhere in your PATH. For example:
  `cp adb-sync /usr/local/bin/`

Usage
=====

To get a full help, type:

```
adb-sync --help
```

To synchronize your music files from ~/Music to your device, type one of:

```
adb-sync ~/Music /sdcard
adb-sync ~/Music/ /sdcard/Music
```

To synchronize your music files from ~/Music to your device, deleting files you
removed from your PC, type one of:

```
adb-sync --delete ~/Music /sdcard
adb-sync --delete ~/Music/ /sdcard/Music
```

To copy all downloads from your device to your PC, type:

```
adb-sync --reverse /sdcard/Download/ ~/Downloads
```

ADB Channel
===========

This package also contains a separate tool called adb-channel, which is a
convenience wrapper to connect a networking socket on the Android device to
file descriptors on the PC side. It can even launch and shut down the given
application automatically!

It is best used as a `ProxyCommand` for SSH (install
[SSHelper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arachnoid.sshelper)
first) using a configuration like:

```
Host sshelper
Port 2222
ProxyCommand adb-channel tcp:%p com.arachnoid.sshelper/.SSHelperActivity 1
```

After adding this to `~/.ssh/config`, run `ssh-copy-id sshelper`.

Congratulations! You can now use `rsync`, `sshfs` etc. to the host name
`sshelper`.
